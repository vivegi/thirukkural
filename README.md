I am embarking on a passion project on the side and looking for collaborators.  Concept: Bring classical Tamil literary works to the younger generation in digital / multimedia formats  Works Chosen: To start with we shall begin with the classical work Tirukkuṟaḷ (திருக்குறள்). Other works shall be taken up in due course.  Help needed: We need volunteers in multiple skill areas.  -- Illustrators: Each of the 133 chapters and each of the 1330 verses shall be illustrated -- Content editors: Responsible for formatting and organizing the content under the project's standards and guidelines -- Translators: Responsible for translating the verses into different languages. Our goal is to make this work accessible in every language. -- Designers: Responsible for the layout and design of artefacts  We probably need more roles. This is just a starting list.  Targeted Delivery formats: Physical flash cards, eBook, print book, Website, App to start with.  This is a massive project. If you love Tamil language and classical works, have the skills and would like to volunteer or contribute in some form, please mention it in the comment or InMail me.  This GitHub repository is for managing the collaboration workspace and artefacts.
